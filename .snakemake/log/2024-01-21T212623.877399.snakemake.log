LibMambaUnsatisfiableError: Encountered problems while solving:
  - nothing provides requested blast
  - nothing provides blast needed by orthofinder-2.3.10-0

Could not solve for environment specs
The following packages are incompatible
├─ blast does not exist (perhaps a typo or a missing channel);
└─ orthofinder is not installable because it requires
   └─ blast, which does not exist (perhaps a missing channel).
